# codecrafters-shell

This repo is my personal implementation of codecrafter's Build your own Shell challenge using C.

Bash-like shell features: 

 - built-in commands: exit, echo, pwd, cd, type
 - execute external commands
 - stdout redirection
 - supports quoting (single and double), backslash

## Requirements
CMake, a C compiler

 1. Clone this repo
 2. Inside the repo, build with the following:
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
 3. Run:

```
